# Rust crawler to gather links list from a webpage

## Compilation
Just launch `cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy && cargo build --release --bin rust-crawler` so that all your code will be linted and checked.  
*NB*:Rust `1.36` or newer is needed.  

## Usage
Link to be crawled is hardcoded for now, so just launch the binary you built.
